# Brainstorm
For today I will most likely use PHP as I have the most experience in that language and I think it's easy enough to do it with that.\
I will have to look for a way to isolate strings between these charachters ':', ';' and ',' then I will store the values for a set, id and amount of blocks.

## Part 1
All went straight-forward and worked surprisingly well, onto part 2.

## Part 2
Part 2 was no trouble either as I simply adjusted the code from part 1

## Usage
Straight forward again. You will need PHP v8 for this.

### Step 1
Put your input in a txt file called 'input.txt.

### Step 2
Get your answer for part 1 with: <p>php program.php</p>

### Step 3
Get your answer for part 2 with: <p>php programtwo.php</p>
