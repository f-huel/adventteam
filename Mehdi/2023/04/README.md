# Brainstorm
Ok this is straight forward. A few explodes and array intersects should do the trick right.\
I will ofcourse be doing this in PHP. I cba to deal with C.\
Finally something easy.

# Brainstorm Part 2
This went just like expected, relatively smoothly unfortunately I had to go before I could finish part 2.\
So for part 2 I was considering going for a recursive function but then I figured I can just have an array that works like card counter.\
I will try to explain the logic of the code.\
First it saves the id then it uses that to add to the counter array. Incrementing for the count we calculate.

## Usage
Luckily everything went smoothly and per usual here's the program for you to use.\
You will need PHP installed for this.

### Step 1
Copy-paste your input in a file named 'input.txt'\

### Step 2
For part 1 use: <p>php program.php</p>

### Step 3
For part 2 use: <p>php parttwo.php</p>
